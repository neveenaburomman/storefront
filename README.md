# storefront

## phase 1 : Application State with Redux
 we begin the first of a 4-Phase build of the storefront application, written in React. In this first phase, our goal is to setup the basic scaffolding of the application with initial styling and basic behaviors. This initial build sets up the file structure and state management so that we can progressively build this application in a scalable manner.
## phase 2 : Combined Reducers
we added the “Add to Cart” feature to our application, which will allow our users to not only browse items in the store, but also select them and have them persist in their “shopping cart” for later purchase.

## phase 3 :  Redux - Asynchronous Actions
we connected the Store to an API to retrieve live data from your data source by using thunk to enable asynchronous actions 
## phase 4 : 
Completed the work on the Store by adding view detail for each individual products
